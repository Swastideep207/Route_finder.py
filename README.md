# Route_finder.py



Purpose of the Code : 
The program solves a shortest path problem in a graph using three algorithms:
Bi-directional BFS: Searches from both the start and goal nodes simultaneously to find the shortest path.
Standard BFS: Searches from the start node level by level to find a shortest path.
DFS (Depth-First Search): Explores deeply along each branch before backtracking, which may not guarantee the shortest path.
